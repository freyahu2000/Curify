# Curify Business Metrics Dashboard

This is a simple internal dashboard for visualizing business and user engagement metrics on Curify Studio. It is built with **FastAPI** (Python backend) and a responsive **HTML/Chart.js** frontend.


## 📊 Metrics Tracked

- **Daily Active Users (DAU):**  
  Unique users who created at least one project on the selected date.  
  → Based on `project.created_at`.

- **Weekly Active Users (WAU):**  
  Unique users who created projects in the past 7 days ending on the selected date.

- **New Registrations:**  
  Number of new users created on the selected date.  
  → From `user.created_at`.

- **Daily Revenue ($):**  
  Total revenue generated from transactions on the selected date.  
  → From `transaction.created_at`.

- **Monthly Revenue ($):**  
  Total revenue generated in the **last 30 days** ending on the selected date.

- **Paid Users:**  
  Number of distinct users who made a transaction on the selected date.

- **User Distribution (Free vs Pro):**  
  Based on active subscriptions in the `subscription` table.


## 🧠 Assumptions & Notes

- Metrics are based on project/user/transaction timestamps in UTC.
- Users without active `Pro` subscriptions are categorized as **Free**.
- Monthly revenue is **rolling 30-day**, not calendar-based.
- The dashboard works with a local PostgreSQL database (`curify_local`) and assumes standard table structure.
